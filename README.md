*Abandoned - We no longer do cutups*

# Cutup Framework

A set of HTML/CSS/JS files that are a jumping-off/starting point for doing a site cutup. This list of files can be used as reference or as a starter set of files so the developer assigned a site cutup has something that follows the SV CMS general structure. This structure refers to how the files are named, placed in folders (i.e. assets), as well as how the HTML/CSS nomenclature follows our current CMS code. A developer using this framework is expected to clean it up free of the 'test content' and removing unnecessary code prior to completing their assigned cutup.
